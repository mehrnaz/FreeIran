In 2026, nationwide protests spread across Iran, evolving into one of the most severe crackdowns in the country’s recent history. Demonstrations occurred in cities and small towns across all provinces, with civilians calling for political, social, and economic change.

Security forces responded with live ammunition, mass arrests, and widespread internet shutdowns that severely restricted documentation and independent reporting.

Investigations and testimony from medical workers, morgue staff, and human rights organizations describe:

  - Close-range gunshot wounds to protesters
  
  - Overwhelmed hospitals and forensic facilities
  
  - Bodies transported in refrigerated trucks
  
  - Reports of mass burials
  
  - Allegations of torture, forced confessions, and sexual violence in detention
  
  - Intimidation of families seeking the bodies of loved ones

Official figures acknowledge thousands of deaths. Independent organizations and medical networks suggest the true toll may be significantly higher than 33,000. Due to communications blackouts and restricted access to the country, the full scale of the fatalities remains uncertain.

The combination of lethal force, mass detention, and efforts to obscure the number of dead should raise urgent international concerns about accountability and human rights in Iran. Somthing Must be Done!
